 * view" for a session whose page is called "Checkout" is the worse of the two
 * labels, so the body publishes and the title prefers what it published.
 *
 * One browser-view tab per session is what the kind declares (no `multiple`),
 * so the session id alone identifies the entry: there is no second tab whose
 * title could overwrite the first one's.
