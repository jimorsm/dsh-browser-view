/**
 * DSH's own authentication page, and the single launch-token retry a
 * navigation to it gets.
 *
 * A fresh `dsh web` process prints a URL carrying `?token=<launch token>`.
 * A request to the site root with that token answers 303 to the clean address
 * and sets the `dsh-auth-<authority>` cookie; every later request is served
 * from the cookie. A browser profile that never received the token — an
 * ephemeral `--user-data-dir`, which is exactly what this plugin launches —
 * sees the 401 challenge instead, whose body is the sentence matched here.
 *
 * The host's connection service can mint that same token for any URL
 * (`ctx.connection.authenticatedUrl`), which is what makes the retry possible
 * without this package depending on that SDK.
 *
 * If DSH rewords the challenge, {@link AUTH_CHALLENGE_TEXT} simply stops
 * matching: the capability degrades to showing the authentication page exactly
 * as before, and no other site's page is ever mistaken for ours.
