/**
 * Semantic attributes for the browser-view surface (semantic-attrs-v1).
 *
 * The plugin name lives on the root element of each surface so part values stay
 * bare words; a theme anchors on the pair, never on a part name that repeats
 * the plugin. The right-sidebar chip and the shell's tab strip around it are
 * not ours, so only this plugin's own elements are stamped.
 *
 * The body's part names follow the shipped browser tab's structure - a toolbar
 * with an address display, the frame, and the action trace - so a theme that
 * already anchors on that chrome reaches this tab the same way.
